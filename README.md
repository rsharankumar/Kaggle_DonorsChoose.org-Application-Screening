The folder structures are as follows,

The code PreliminaryWorks.ipynb has multiple compoments to it. It is used to format the files <br />
and folders into a standard structure so that the prediction model can be built on top of it.<br />
And also for the creation of the following files, train_data.csv, test_data.csv and validation_data.csv.<br />

The keras_vggmodel.ipynb is code where the actual deep learning model is implemented. <br />
The final solution was not submitted as the time for subimssion elapsed. <br />
Guess the final final could have been slightly better than my previous best.
